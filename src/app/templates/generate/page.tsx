const introMessage = `Hi! ðŸ‘‹ What do you want to build today?

I specialize in generating steps for setting up a project template. Here are a few things I can help you with:
- Creating a README file
- Setting up a Dockerfile
- Configuring linters and formatters
- Adding a logger
- Setting up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Creating other necessary configuration files

If you have a specific project in mind, let me know the details! For example, you can ask for help with setting up a React project, a Node.js backend, or any other type of project.

Would you like to add additional tools like linters, formatters, or a logger to your project setup? Let me know how I can assist you further!`
